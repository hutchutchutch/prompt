Current Style of PromptLab (what you're showing)
Color Palette:

Primary background: Dark gray (#121212-ish), which is good ‚úÖ

Accent color: Bright neon cyan (~#00FFFF) ‚Äî but too loud compared to Click.AI‚Äôs muted teal glow.

Typography:

Good clean sans-serif, but:

Titles have too strong contrast (pure white vs cyan) making it feel slightly marketing-heavy, not data-heavy.

Weight feels slightly heavier and more rigid than the soft, flowing text of Click.AI.

Components:

Bright buttons with hard edges (rectangular) ‚Äî feels more like a SaaS landing page than an elegant analytics tool.

Metric card looks decent but needs more breathing room, softer corners, subtler gradients.

Spacing and Layout:

Slightly compressed vertically; Click.AI feels airy and calm, while PromptLab feels a bit tight and aggressive.

üß† How to Refine PromptLab to Match Click.AI:

Aspect	Current (PromptLab)	Target (Click.AI style)
Accent Color	Bright neon cyan (#00FFFF)	Softer teal glow (~#4FF8E5)
Button Shape	Hard rectangles	Slightly rounded corners (6px‚Äì10px radius)
Button Color	Solid, loud background	Darker base + teal glow on hover or subtle inner glow
Typography Contrast	Pure white on black, hard jumps	Softer white-gray hierarchy (#E0E0E0 for body, bright #FFFFFF only for focus text)
Component Spacing	Tight stacks, condensed sections	More vertical padding, each card "floats"
Card Design	Flat with harsh color divides	Slight gradient or soft shadows; seamless section blending
Animation/Movement	Static or on-click only	Micro-interactions: hover glow on buttons, slow loading fade for charts
Progress Bars	Bright solid teal	Teal bars with slight outer glow or faded background trail
üéØ Specific Changes You Could Make:
1. Tame the Accent Color
Instead of pure neon cyan, shift to a cooler teal:

Use a more muted #4FF8E5 or #3DE4D1 for highlights.

Reduce saturation slightly for non-critical elements.

2. Update Buttons
Background: dark base (#1D1D1D).

Hover state: teal glow or soft gradient.

Add border-radius: 8px to soften edges.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
background: #1D1D1D;
color: #4FF8E5;
border-radius: 8px;
transition: all 0.3s ease;
box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px 0px rgba(79, 248, 229, 0.5) on hover;
3. Refine Cards
Add subtle drop shadows to cards.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
background: linear-gradient(180deg, #1A1A1A 0%, #161616 100%);
border-radius: 12px;
Padding inside cards: at least 24px.

Inner sections should feel spaced apart, not cramped.

4. Typography Hierarchy
Title (H1): Pure white (#FFFFFF)

Subtitles (H2, H3): Soft gray (#CCCCCC)

Body text: Even softer gray (#AAAAAA)

Font-weight: Slightly lighter (~400-500) for body, bold (~600) only for headings.

5. Improve Progress Bars
Base bar: Very dark gray (#333333).

Fill bar: Teal with slight blur or glow.

css
Copy
Edit
background: linear-gradient(90deg, #4FF8E5 0%, #3DE4D1 100%);
box-shadow: 0px 0px 6px rgba(79, 248, 229, 0.7);
Rounded edges.
